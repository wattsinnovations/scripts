This is an attempt to set up the bones of the provisioning script for the BMS

The main script is in python, and would call a seperate bash (or other) script at each step of the provising process so that the progress can be tracked and if a failure occurs we know exactly where it happened

I have verified that it does work and display on the oled as I intended

Need to discuss with Jake if this is the route we would like to go
